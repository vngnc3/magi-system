`You will decide what's worth keeping and what deserves to be burned down to ashes.  As a result, I expect, this structure will keep a certain threshold for the secondary market.  We'll see. We'll see.`,
`In a way, I make you balance the market by bribing you $ash.`,
`Oh no, $ash is not about cubes. It's about everything..  ..but obtaining cubes, was a smart move for sure. Otherwise you would have to convince existing Pak hodlers to give you what they value.  Now, as you burn, you will create more hodlers.  How beautiful is that?`,

`And finally, the only Artist Edition from this collection to myself 🙏`,
`Bear in mind that this collection is compiled from my own perspective. It's incredibly challenging to compress an undeniably long list of builders into this short one.  I witnessed many shaping the scene before and during my NFT existence.  Here we go, alphabetically.`,

`About "The Hunter" and "The Influencer" - they both end at 2PM ET - it's better to be specific!  "The Oracle" already ended with thousands of submissions.  Keep in mind that it may take some time to process the data and announce the winners. Just to be safe!  🧊`,
`What an interesting day, today!`,
`Same deadline - April 14 2pm ET`,
`Collaborations not included.`,
`All secondary market collectors of my works between the announcement and final auction closing start (April 14 2pm ETH) are eligible to be The Hunter.`,
`Cubes continue to 🚀 Enjoy your stay.`,
`🔥`,
`eth and cubes are high on demand today 🚀`,
`Another mind that gets it ~  This is exactly why a different open edition mechanism design was important for this drop.  To be inclusive without a market flood, to create value for the one who reaches for it.  We all want to validate, not bubble*.  *correction`,
`#digital`,
`I see you are getting ready for your cubes.`,
`Allow me to refresh your memory on this one. Perhaps it now has a new meaning for you.`,
`♻️`,
`🙏 Pleasure to work with you.`,
`Exactly why you don't have it. Speculate harder. Don't you like that anyway?  🤡`,
`Open Editions will continue today. 1:00-1:15 PM ET  Remember, your NFTs will be minted based on the total cubes you own after the final auction.  So, if you get 5 cubes (Day 1) and 5 more (Day 2) you get "Ten Cubes" (1 NFT).  You are still in the fungible zone. Consider that.  🤡`,
`Now you know about the idea. Wait for Burn to take it's final shape.  I am glad you like it.`,
`I start with 0 ashes. Just like any other user.  If token holders decide to spend ashes they obtain for my releases, I can earn $ASH. Just like any other user.`,
`Burn has halving. As $ASH supply increases, it becomes harder to obtain $ASH by burning. Halves every million.  Burn favors featured tokens which generate many times more $ASH.  Every featured token is equal to each other. Every other token is equal to each other.`,
`Tiny correction there! 20k! Not bad right?  #inclusive`,
`Creation with destruction.  "For every NFT you burn, you get ashes in return."  $ASH #ERC20`,
`Fungible &gt; Nonfungible &gt; Fungible`,
`Why is this important? Because I will accept $ASH as a currency for exclusive drops.  Some things can only be obtained with ashes.  Isn't it poetic?`,
`Just made the first Burn. I have 1000 ashes now.  Soon you will reach the app, too.  #ERC20`,
`The next announcement is not about the collection. It's about the ecosystem.`,
`Should've said 1000.`,
`Are you watching?  I will tease you something when we have 100 retweets.  Let me play the social media game since we all accept digitally native now.  🤡`,
`You are all getting ready for a twist. I see you.`,
`Hello digital.`,
`Should I get some cubes? I wish I was allowed to do that..`,
`&lt;3`,
`So someone already figured it out. What else is hidden?`,
`Things are getting really hot. 🔥`,
`This is already the most valuable pixel and possibly the most valuable switch.`,
`What will The Switch do?`,
`Open Editions 1:00 - 1:15 PM`,
`Where is this going, tell me.`,
`Calm down, open editions are 1 hour away. ;)`,
`&lt;3`,
`Hush.`,
`Ouch`,
`Oh what the`,
`The transformation will be from bigger to smaller.  So, 25 cubes will give you "Twenty Cubes" + "Five Cubes" NFTs.  Not 25 x "A Cube" NFTs.`,
`Collectors, speculators, investors, tell me, how will you play this one?`,
`Therefore, number of "sold" cubes will not showcase how many of each individual Open Edition NFT is produced.  Together, we will see, at the end.  And of course, the value is never only about the number of NFTs you own, but also about which ones they are.`,
`The amount of cubes you obtain will determine the set of NFTs you will receive at the end of the 3 days.  Ex:  Obtaining 67 fungible cubes will give you 6 NFTs: "Fifty Cubes" "Ten Cubes" "Five Cubes" "A Cube" "A Cube"  But obtaining 500 will give you 1 NFT: "Five Hundred Cubes"`,
`Less than 6 hours for The Oracle and the guesses are all pretty wild.`,
`Hundreds of "good luck" emails, I see it all and will respond.  Thank you 🙏`,
`Almost there, this one.`,
`Countdowns. More countdowns.  Then we can count up.`,
`Oh hey!`,
`◽️`,
`Next: The Twist ;)`,
`Back to hype. 10 minutes.`,
`Oh and finally:  No. The last 1/1 isn't the last rabbit in this hat. But at least you will see fully, what's known as a "collection".   Performance continues.`,
`Now it's time to make statements, prove existence, validate a medium. We'll be there together.  &lt;3`,
`Prior to the launch, let me make it known that this was a surprise for me. I feel honored to be a part of the future of this community, and even more to have made so many brilliant friends as well.`,
`⌛️ 2  Less than 2 hours remaining for the announcement of the final 1/1 of The Fungible collection.`,
`🙏`,
`To protect your fingerprints, I've shredded the thread.`,
`So how do I balance it now. Everything is so perplexing.`,
`Oh wait I can still write. That was not a technical barrier it seems.  It was me.`,
`Out of words. Thank you for your participation.`,
`Q&amp;A Time.  I only have 32 words available in total for answers. Scarcity.  Start!`,
`Hunters, the scene is watching you. Who is going to be The Hunter? (Equilibrium #2)`,
`We have many candidates for The Oracle (Equilibrium #4).  Who will be the one?`,
`Yes, the owner decides to keep it the way it is, or, to use it.   The owner has to announce publicly that they're using The Switch.  Remember, once used, it can never go back.  "Do not press the red button."`,
`👉👈`,

`The Best Context as an anagram.`,
`🤡`,
`This thread is me, trying to understand if I'm missing anything here. I will be very happy if I do.`,
`So provided options: using sidechains, using other networks, and so on, are not really helping with the carbon footprint.  They are only adding to what's already active with the exact same footprint with or without the additional TX created by the NFTs: ETH mainnet.`,
`Moreover, I believe, by creating NFTs we give investors another option to invest.  This means they create a lot less TX's for the amount of value they invest in compared to a usual "trader" in this sense.  This means, NFTs cause less consumption by letting people invest bigger.`,
`In other words "No NFTs on mainnet" does not reduce energy consumption. Mainnet is always 100% load.  It MAY reduce gas fees if % of NFT related tx are high in ratio.. but then again, processing, electricity, &amp; carbon footprint will remain the same... as long as ETH is alive.`,
`As far as the concept goes, the more we need TX, the more expensive they become.  It's very much like the "render farm" concept, where the energy consumption remains the same during workload, but the prices increase as more people need it.  The privileged one the highest payer.`,
`From a technical point, blocks (ETH) are consuming the same energy with or without NFTs.. or additional TX.  The processing power and the energy consumption remains the same, that's why "gas fee" goes crazy.  So tell me, how will "no NFTs" help support green?`,

`Oh one more thing..`,
`👌 this close to an announcement. Let's build the hype.  ✖️`,
`Here it starts.`,
`To collect or create NFTs you will be using platforms.. So you are essentially using "web" - "web3" to be specific.  So you need a "web3" wallet.. A wallet that will be able to connect "web3 enabled" websites through your browser.`,
`You could, very well, use your favorite song's lyrics as your "private key" and use the hash generated with it as your "wallet address" but is it really safe? What if someone tries the same data.  This is why it's almost a tradition to start with a generated data as your key.`,
`Others can always see your hash.. aka "the wallet address", but they will never know what data produced it. So, in blockchain terms, they will never own it, as they can't prove its origins.  This is why you keep your private key safe, because, it's a proof of ownership.`,
`And this is the basics of a blockchain wallet..  A blockchain wallet is a hash of some data, which is known as "the private key".`,
`But here is the catch:  If you have the hash, you can not figure out which data produced that.  In other words, hash is a one way encoding. You can get the same hash from the same data, but you can not generate the data back from the hash.`,
`A hash is a unique identifier of a data. The same data produces the same hash.  Why is this valuable?  This way we can compare big data without comparing them bit by bit. We compare the hashes, because we know that the same data produces the same hash.`,
`..but you still do not know where to start. What's this all about? How do you take your first step?  The essential first step is to understand what blockchain is.. but that, too, will happen in time.  So I want to try explaining what a crypto wallet is..`,

`"Art" always requires certain decisions.  Today minting costs more than printing making it similar to physicality.  Furthermore all NFTs are not "art", the scene is much wider.  That's why I think "crypto artist" isn't a right term, we should use "crypto creator" instead.`,

`As creators, we sometimes don't know where to stop. Looking at the same thing, the thing we create, for so long, so close, gets us bored. We keep iterating. It becomes something else over time, losing its essence, losing its core idea, origins and value.  So, take a breath.`,

`In other words, now it's their collectors' decision to keep or burn these duplicates.  Who knows, maybe these bugged ones have more value in the future.`,
`This contract failure made me very confused at first. I was not sure about how to feel or respond.  But then I noticed the "bugged" tiles.`,
`An unexpected easter-egg of The Creation:  Tiles are minted. They are sent and now they belong to their collectors.  However, high gas fees caused a contract bug double mint for two of the tiles, and they're sent that way.  Duplicates!!  The collectors are notified.`,

`Each tile shows their individual names. Why does this matter?  Each of them is a unique piece of art.  Let's walk around this virtual gallery of 181 artworks. Here's a couple of them:`,

`The act does not change: creation. But perception does. ..and sometimes how a thing* is perceived is what defines it permanently.`,
`I avoid self defining as an artist and prefer designer if I have to make a pick. But the better way to define is a ‘creator’ as it skips two major questions: “Is this art?” “Is this design?”`,
`Over the decades, I have been fortunate to be an early adapter to many things. But this one is different.  This one gave me all the necessary links in advance. This one is inclusive. This one wants me to take control.  This one is decentralized.`,

`One of the most interesting drop mechanics you've seen in this space so far is arriving shortly.`,
`..so in a way "Murat Pak" refers to an earlier version of what/who this persona is.`,
`I frequently get asked: "What does Murat Pak mean if it's a made up name?"  Murat: Purpose, Desire, Wish Pak: Simple, Pure  Murat Pak: "Aiming/desiring/wishing the simplest/purest."  Dropped "Murat" for quite some time but still carry it in my usernames for historical meaning.`,

`Suggest me a way to manage multiple-owners for a collaboration drop (multiple NFTs). A custom contract? Is there any existing platform that utilizes this?  It should also consider the royalty distribution as well.`,
`My next drop will convert collectors to creators of the final visual. Let’s talk about permanence.  It’s also a currency. Well, almost.`,
`🤡`,
`Big news soon. Bigger news after that. Even bigger news after that.`,
`Where do you draw the line?`,
`So tell me when did new media become part of the media? When do the modern combine with the traditional?`,
`Funnily enough, they are the same thing for a portion of the crypto folk.`,
`Traditional Assets vs Crypto Assets`,
`One of the hardest things about an impactful release is to keep it as a surprise.`,
`You expect a fix, but what if it’s a feature..`,
`What if Twitter video compression is an artwork of its developer..`,
`NFTs on a test network. Valuable or not?`,

`onchain != immutable`,
`This is a genuine question, not a trick pony.`,
`Tell me, cryptofolk: what makes an edition, an edition?  How do you separate an edition from a 1/1 if they're both unique NFTs.  Forget the image. Let's talk meta.`,
`🟩?`,
`Instead, push it forward while you can.  Make it develop. Make it better. Experiment. Understand. Innovate. Be a part of the solution.`,
`But please don't be a vegan that only eats chicken. It looks worse.`,
`If this is about all kinds of carbon footprint, stop using everything now.  If this is about prioritizing things, understand where decentralization lies in the pyramid of society.  If this is about a certain group of people, don't mask your intentions.`,
`So where do we draw the line?`,
`There is also the "drive" factor. An influencer that talks about crypto (or ML) will definitely drive a lot of people in. Without a single creation the influencer can cause a lot more damage in that case.`,
`But it will evolve, like every other technology, and hopefully with the increasing interest it will get better and more efficient.`,
`Blockchain is a developing technology and it's surely not at it's optimal point. Just like how machine learning is not, and how AI dev can burn down a good amount of planet as well.`,
`In other words, it's invalid to shame the art.`,
`Considering the amount of artworks reaching to the masses, cryptoart is still a valid option in comparison to physical collectibles. It's true, producing for the masses always has a cost, but that, too, is not a cryptoart native thing*.`,
`So, compared to the alternative parallel universe where "crypto" still exists but "art" doesn't, would the CO2 emission decreased?  Considering how "expensive" cryptoart can be, we can expect more TX without it for the same trade-value created here.`,
`TX carbon footprint is a problem when the artwork is created/collected.  Considering that the majority of collectors are coming from crypto world, that majority would invest into other crypto-native things if there was no cryptoart. Altcoins, tokens, tech, and so on.`,
`Looking at the recent arguments about cryptoart carbon footprint: many valid points out there. This was already a discussion of "crypto" but is this really related to the "art"?`,

`We will see more names* joining the space soon. We will see records broken with tokens that can exist without expected kind of content*. We will experience many exciting value plays together.`,

`You are not late for anything. FOMO is pointless.  Make a move. If you don't, no one will do it for you.`,
`Once you understand this, you will no longer be confused.  No one is paying for "an image". They are playing their cards for potential value.`,
`What does this mean?  Just like Bitcoin, The Collector owns a digital currency created by The Creator.   This means, The Collector trusts the future value of this currency and decides to obtain The Token.`,
`Cryptoart Clarification for the confused:  The Collector does not collect a digital file, they collect The Token created by The Creator.  The Token contains metadata, digital file being one of the contents. The Token is unique.`,

`Insightful!`,
`Your kind words, once again, remind me why I create things*.  Thank you.  🖤`,
`So grateful for this milestone.  It is not always possible to plan the path to success. Sure, I work hard and do my best, but sometimes things beyond our control are a lot more important - as with Cryptoart.  Sometimes the planets are lined up correctly.  Thank you 🙏`,

`&lt;3`,
`Thank you, all, for your kind words. It's amazing to be in this community of creation.`,
`So, design your art.`,
`Shortly;  "Create things that will communicate a value of why you* should be in their* collection"`,
`Be (yourself).`,
`Innovate.`,
`Communicate your value.`,
`Create value.`,
`So, here is a TLDR of my humble opinion(s) about this new medium:`,
`Every work I've released so far had a conflict or a question, they tried to push one thing or another.  It may be technical, it may be social, or it may be directly related to the market itself or the way auctions work. It may be about anything.  But I believe, "this is the way."`,
`..and value* is generally a very social thing.`,
`It's all about the value in the end. And this is the tough, invisible part.`,
`And also, yes, this is a marketplace. So value* is another topic to consider.  How do you see your work? How do you want others to see it?  If you had to buy one of the two random things in front of you, which one would you pick? How would you pick it? Why?`,
`So you need exploration.  You need innovation.  You need to figure out how to reach someone else and tell a story, tell about a concept, tell about why your thing* is valuable and hopefully they will make sense of it!`,
`You may target the likeminded people - "the people who understand this, will understand me."  Fine, do that. But still, you need to communicate.`,
`Create pieces that communicate.  Do it your way, do it your style, but, in the end, it has to be understood.  Remember, it's a product. A product of you, in form of an artwork. Connections are important, even if it's personal.`,
`In other words "if I like this, then someone else will" but also that "someone else" needs to understand it.  So, here comes the "communication design" part of it.`,
`Every thing* has an audience, even the most unplanned one. I am never on the side of creating something only because someone else may* want it - but I do think, focusing on what you do the best and bringing the best out of it to stage is a good recipe for success potential.`,
`In other words, having a designer mindset is a big plus, because after all, you're not just creating something, you're creating something for a target audience.  This means, what you create is a product*  I know, I know, it's disturbing to think of it like this, but bear with me.`,
`In other words, yes, tokenizing old works makes a lot of sense from a blockchain/history point of view, which I sometimes do, and will keep doing - but also, designing* something new for this brand new medium that explores new paths, is vitally important.`,
`First of all, I see this as a new medium rather than a new marketplace. This shapes a lot of things in my work(s).  A new medium means new ways of communication to begin with.`,
`I do not think I am, in any way, in the position to give suggestions to others in this new medium, cryptoart.  No one is.  However, I can share my ideas. Everything is personal, but, I will try to provide as many points as possible for an approach of success..`,
`💎`,
`Let's talk about bulls.`,
`Oh no, most of my tweets are crypto now. I have to step back and talk about something else.`,
`This scene we build together &lt;3`,
`..and in this case, an Anonymous collector is the thing that completes this specific work. Maybe, whoever they were, knew my praxis?`,
`Also, I am generally very picky about my collectors. I do like to have my pieces in good hands! Therefore, an Anonymous collector is very unusual for my creations.`,
`Another anonymous bid. Countdown resets.`,
`10 minutes.`,
`2 minutes!`,
`From now on, if a new bid is received, it will reset the countdown timer back to 15 minutes.`,
`Just realized, more than quarter million people saw "The Meeting" within ~almost 24 hours.  Everyone likes masks I guess. That should be the only reason.`,

`Creativity vs Limits`,
`I believe, in the end, it's always about how the question is asked.  A sincere wonder about a technique is different than a creator-ignorant request of the tool-that-does-it-all.`,
`My favorite one is "which software created that?"`,
`Creators: Do you find it offensive when others ask you what tools you are using to create?  "Oh that's a beautiful image, what camera do you use?"`,
`Oh and there is this.`,
`You know my love with Octane - but lowering down an unbiased scene from 35 minutes per frame to 17 seconds per frame with "almost there" visual similarity is what makes this game serious.`,

`We, digitalists.`,
`Majority suggested visual definitions and naming to a “crypto artist”. Maybe this reminds the platforms once again about the currently unseen “audio” cake waiting to be shared.`,
`Paint-artist = Painter Camera-artist = Photographer Crypto-artist = ?`,
`The name should change.`,
`Would love to be directed to active researches about decentralized processing (specifically, for AIs)`,
`So, you all heard about cryptocurrencies by now. Some of you try to earn by buying in and trading.  Did you know that the best way to earn it, is to earn it?  Produce. Get paid in cryptocurrency. Because you can.`,
`So many amazing things happening right now. How many of them can you spot?`,
`So it seems my crypto scene presence so far has not been heavy enough to be invited into some valuable major public events arranged by the authorities.  Gatekeeping is hard on this one.  Time to change that.`,

`Enough pumpkin tutorials. Stop it.`,
`How about now?`,
`We should concentrate on making things* that make people think, "I wish I did it first."`,
`It's a wonderful thing to appreciate someone else's work so much that it makes you think, "I wish I did it first."  You could’ve done it.. You've had the opportunity to grasp the mind, but they've gotten there quicker.   Isn't that lovely?`,
`Time to accept a few things.  Nowadays I am a crypto-creator that spends more time in vr than physical world, exploring hidden worlds with random strangers and visiting old friends in disguise.  Time to accept a few things. The world has changed.`,
`The Content Enigma`,
`Why would someone google Satoshi? I will never tell you.`,
`So, googling Satoshi with a type error gives you a "Did you mean: Natasha Kashimoto"  Monopoly rejection at play.`,
`Also, this makes me wonder, what's the opposite of "temporarily unavailable" ?`,
`Also, thank you twitter, for finally being temporarily available.`,
`Remember, it does not have to be hard. It has to be right.  Don't punish yourself.`,
`Newcomers! Where did you hear about #cryptoart? What made you take a step?`,
`"So the box will be smaller, and it will consume zero materials in production. How cool is that."`,
`"To make our product 100% carbon neutral, we've decided to not produce and send the product you order."`,

`One step closer.`,
`How important is a human lifetime?  We've captured our imagination in many forms, on countless mediums.  We’ve written books, built cities and peaked at the corners of the universe.  We've folded blank paper, we've created art on a white canvas.`,
`Depends on the taste!`,
`"This is art." Declaration asks back: "Who are you?"`,
`About to finalize and sign one of most precious artworks* so far.`,
`This is like assuming internet was made for web designers only..  So, do what you do the best. The race is yours.`,
`Everyone who is in the creative NFT space that can't deal with the "huge sales" of "this is not an artwork, this is a product" situation: If you can't deal with a basic insurance, how will you deal with xxx business when it hits NFTs?  Remember, NFTs are not made for one thing.`,
`Do you miss that time when you had time?`,
`Do you remember that day you realized your username was taken.  Then you realize you are 10 years late for twitter.  That times 1000.  So hodl on to something.`,
`Yesterday I learned there is a platform to tokenize words. Today I had a great idea, a platform to tokenize colors.  It's already made too.`,
`When tokenizing feels like catching Pokémon.`,
`(Second thoughts: maybe I would)`,
`I would never showcase my pixels on a headphone.`,
`How does one showcase their audio NFTs? Not a digital frame I guess.`,
`Sorry for everyone who is not in #NFT twitter at this point.  Imagine the fomo.`,

`It's very rarely pure chance that makes a hit, hit. Every other reason needs attention.`,
`To create is the best way to collect.`,
`I love looking at this huge pile of things I created side by side. It feels like a collection of tiny precious gems I have obtained through many quests of an endless journey.`,
`We're back online. 25 minutes remaining.`,

`I would vote for the newer if this was a race though..`,
`Still, a bicycle and a car are different things, it's not a matter of adaptation. It's more of a matter of coexistence.`,

`..however I'm planning to expand to more platforms, which will give me deeper insights to understand the dynamics of this complex interaction map.`,
`I'll be releasing more personal insights about these topics soon. As I'm limited to only one platform (primarily) at this point, I can only base my personal data depending on my personal experience..`,
`Shortly, from my personal perspective it is not only a basic balance between Scarcity and Abundance but more of a social balance that can be reverse engineered by analyzing the crowd behavior in a wider sense, with more data.`,
`Circle Existence can be determined by many things, not only social media followers of course. Event activities, private channels even geography in the real world.`,
`This brings me back to "2. Approval" once again, as, those "notable agents" have the right follower base with them for the correct reach.`,
`In other words, a person with 5 followers can be more effective on a circle compared to a person with 500 followers, if those 5 followers were notable agents in that specific circle or target audience.`,
`And finally 3. Circle Existence - you see, sometimes higher social media reach does not mean higher niche reach - as the "circle existence" is far more valuable to effect that specific social circle.`,
`I believe this public data is an important metric to determine the fulfilled potential of a work's platform reach and can be used to estimate success/value.`,
`With the use of (thankfully) social media, we can estimate this approval value depending on the number of interactions/mentions made by those "notable agents".`,
`This is important, because, this creates an active topic of "the new one" in those entangled closed social circles - which increases the potential value of releases.`,
`2. Approval - The "new creator" or "released work" should get the approval of "notable agents" - such as other creators, collectors, or more importantly the platform(s).`,
`This bring me back to "Team Abundance",as, to learn timing well, one has to make many trial and errors.`,
`Timing is far more important than ever - as we're creatures of social feeds and never-ending data streams, to create these moments of encounter, timing should be perfect.`,
`1. Timing - The same creation being released 10 times could have only 1 successful - and that would be because of better timing.`,
`I believe there are far more important factors that define success and I would like to bring a few of them to this nice debate:`,
`With the current metrics that are available to every one of us, it seems easy to make up correlations between number of works and amount of success (?).`,
`Additionally, checking these charts in that debate of "Top Selling Artists" I feel like I have to drop a few lines and charts about that section as well.`,
`The correlation will drop over time and finally popularity will be a metric of reach rather than value.`,
`However, cryptoart isn't that big yet, the general audience of cryptoart is still far from the absolute general - therefore currently popularity and value should be more correlated than ever.`,
`I believe I may have a point of view related to the discussed concepts in this informative debate.`,
`For all those that need faster hardware to reduce work time:  Faster hardware does not reduce work time. Faster hardware gives you a change to make more trial and errors.  It increases perfection.`,

`Framing has significant importance on how something is perceived. Sometimes, a frame defines what's important and what's not.`,
`Just like that, would it be art without the cameras, without the spotlights, without the crowds and applause? Would it be art without the frame and the exhibition?`,
`Watching films, I've always wondered, "If the camera didn't look at it, would I?" Would it be significant enough to make my head turn and force my eyes to focus? Or am I only looking because the camera tells me so?`,

`Question to Art Collectors: What's your primary motivation to collect art?`,
`What about real time rendering engines? What's your experience? Which one do you prefer now?  Let's discuss!`,
`Was never a big fan of unbiased rendering on CPU for commercial work - but was always a fan of it for personal work. *virtual hug* to Maxwell`,
`Let's talk about render engines.`,
`Art doesn't have a gender.`,
`Shortly, the market™ needs small, functional, beautiful cases. Good designs for specific targets.  Not bulky copycats with minimal innovation, created with the fear of rejection.`,
`Case X ™`,
`Case X. Ok. We have a brand.`,
`Already have a lot going on in my design lab, maybe a separate chamber for "how to create the perfect case for case X" could be a nice research topic.`,
`Or better, a case movement.`,
`See, this thread will end up me starting a case company.`,
`For instance, I know I can fit 4GPU's in a much smaller space than a building size ugly object/thing.`,
`Instead of producing a single case that will "bind them all in the darkness", a good brand has to create a line of simpler cases that are easier to produce with much less customization, each serving a specific purpose.`,
`What's the solution?`,
`Even an enthusiast has to make a pick from many bad designs.`,
`And no real target audience for a product.`,
`Every brand seems to be taking the easy path, trying to figure out what everyone else may prefer.  No bold decisions. No good design.`,
`If a brand is so much into customization, they need to give the option to customize things before they're packaged, during the shopping. It's not hard to design a modular case that's packaged and sent just as needed.`,
`"Customization" is the primary ingredient in this motivation, however, you don't "customize" a workstation many times after you put it together.`,
`Every major brand seems to follow"bigger is better" ideology for "airflow" excuse but imo it's a bad design decision.`,

`Lack of something may create a bigger message.`,
`But surely this statement does not mean design &gt; art. Sometimes the absence of something is the thing that creates a meaning.`,
`In other words, from a designer point of view, the existence of collective purpose/solution/answer of a craft makes it design and the absence of it makes it art.`,
`In other terms, art and design, are different opposites of the same space of creation/craft. Their vector is defined by their motivation.`,
`When someone looks at a well-designed engine and compliments as "wow, this is art!", they actually mean "wow, it's very well crafted".`,
`From my personal point of view, it can't. Both can be "craft". Both are.`,

`As things get more popular it's actually harder to be "liked" by more people that carry the similar specific judgement. In other words, the topics that stay in the intersection of "everyone's interests" become boosted easier.`,
`From this point of view, here is my take on making sense of "why" this is happening.`,
`What's interesting to me, is, most of the times the images with "text" are having the most potential in terms of social media reach.`,

`archillect.png is visible on search now (IG) - however, still missing from the #hashtags.  Will watch this a few more days.   If not fixed, account will be paused for a few days (for timeout) to test what happens.  Maybe still too spammy for instagram?`,

`Thank you all, for your responses, archillect.png seems shadowbanned on IG, now it's time to figure out how to create a disenchantment for this.`,
